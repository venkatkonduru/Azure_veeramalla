## Secret Store CSI Driver

In Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), the Secret Store CSI (Container Storage Interface) driver allows you to securely mount secrets stored in Azure Key Vault into your Kubernetes pods as volumes. This integration enhances security by centralizing secret management and access control in Azure Key Vault, a secure and scalable cloud-based key management service.

### With the Secret Store CSI driver, you can:

1. **Securely Store Secrets**: Store sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, and certificates securely in Azure Key Vault.

2. **Centralized Management**: Manage secrets centrally in Azure Key Vault, allowing for easier lifecycle management, versioning, and access control.

3. **Dynamic Secret Injection**: Dynamically inject secrets into pods at runtime, ensuring that sensitive information is never exposed in plain text or stored in version control systems.

4. **Integration with AKS**: Seamlessly integrate the Secret Store CSI driver with AKS clusters to securely access secrets from Azure Key Vault without exposing them in configuration files or environment variables.
