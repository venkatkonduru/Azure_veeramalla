### Why should we use Azure CLI?

In the scenario where a user repeatedly requests the same resource with identical configurations, using the Azure CLI provides a more efficient approach than creating the resource manually through the Azure UI Portal, which can be time-consuming. The DevOps engineer can write a script to create the resource with specific configurations, store it in a location like GitHub, and share it with other developers.

Consequently, when future requests for the same resource arise, the DevOps engineer can simply copy and paste the script, making minor adjustments as needed, to quickly provision the resource. This frees up time for the engineer to focus on other tasks such as monitoring additional resources.
