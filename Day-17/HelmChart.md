## What is Helm Chart?

- A Helm chart is a package manager for Kubernetes, used to define, install, and manage applications and services on a Kubernetes cluster. It simplifies the deployment and management of complex applications by providing a way to package all the resources and configurations needed for an application into a single, versioned unit.

### Important Components of Helm Chart:

- Chart.yaml: This file contains metadata about the chart, such as the chart name, version, description, maintainers, and other relevant information.

- Templates: Helm templates are Kubernetes manifest files written in the Go template language. These templates are used to generate Kubernetes resources dynamically based on user-defined values and configuration.

- Values.yaml: This file contains default configuration values for the chart. Users can override these values by providing their own values file or specifying individual values on the command line during installation or upgrade.

- Dependencies: Helm charts can depend on other charts. The dependencies are defined in the Chart.yaml file and can be managed using the requirements.yaml file. Helm handles dependency resolution and ensures that all required charts are installed and configured correctly.

- Hooks: Helm supports lifecycle hooks that allow users to execute custom logic at various points during the installation, upgrade, or deletion of a chart. Hooks enable tasks such as database migrations, secret generation, or integration with external systems.

- Charts Repository: Helm charts are often distributed via chart repositories. Chart repositories are collections of Helm charts accessible over HTTP. Helm CLI commands can interact with these repositories to discover, install, and manage charts.

- Helpers: Helm provides built-in functions and helpers that can be used within templates to simplify common tasks such as conditional logic, string manipulation, and resource generation.

- Values Overrides: Users can override default configuration values provided in the values.yaml file by specifying their own values file or passing individual values on the command line during installation or upgrade.

- Release: When a Helm chart is installed onto a Kubernetes cluster, it creates a release. A release is an instance of a Helm chart deployed onto the cluster with a specific configuration. Releases can be managed, upgraded, rolled back, and deleted using Helm commands.

- Linting and Testing: Helm provides tools for linting and testing charts to ensure that they adhere to best practices and work correctly. Linting checks for common issues and errors in the chart, while testing allows users to validate the chart's functionality in a controlled environment.
